# McBanny: Give Your Kids a Safer Internet

A service designed to help make the internet a safer place for children and young people by monitoring activities and blocking malicious websites and removing inappropriate content from search engines.

## Our vision

We believe that the internet should be a place for young people to have access to relevant information, away from content that could harm them in every possible way. The internet is an open field where disseminated content must maintain respect and level for all age groups, and that is why we work so that this becomes real little by little.

Our mission is to transform parents' concern about what their son or daughter consumes on the internet into the certainty that their child is safe and not consuming anything inappropriate on the internet, nor being influenced by harmful websites or strangers online. That said, our vision is to help parents have greater control for the sake of young people and to build a safer, more peaceful internet.
